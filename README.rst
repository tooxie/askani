 Why Askani
------------

Writing django models is a very repetitive task, every model you write is very similar to the previous one, except for class and field names. Writing Meta options is even more tedious beacause you have to remember every available option and use them consistently in your project.

Askani helps you focus just in what's important. You don't need to remember all the available model fields, or the meta options, only type your model's name and the rest will be there for you to choose from. It doesn't matter if you are senior django developer tried of writing models or if you are giving your first steps in this awesome framework, you can find Askani helpful.
